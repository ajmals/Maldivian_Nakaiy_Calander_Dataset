# Maldivian Nakaiy Calander Dataset
Dataset on the ancient Maldivian Nakaiy calendar system, extracted from Hassan Ahmed Maniku's 1989 book.

## Description
This dataset contains information on the ancient Maldivian Nakaiy system, a traditional calendar based on lunar mansions (asterisms) used for determining seasons, auspicious times, fishing, and agriculture. It divides the year into two monsoons: Hulhangu (South-West, 18 Nakaiy) and Iruvai (North-East, 9 Nakaiy). Each Nakaiy includes details like start/end dates, names/meanings in multiple languages (Divehi, Arabic, Sinhala), presiding divinities/regents, wind directions, speeds, rainfall, and sunshine hours.

The data was extracted and compiled from the book "NAKAIY" by Hassan Ahmed Maniku. This system has roots in ancient Indian (Indus Valley) and Sinhala traditions, as discussed in the book.
